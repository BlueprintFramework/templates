This repository is made to keep templates seperate from Blueprint's release files and to easely allow for community-made templates through pull requests and contributions.

Introduction to theming with Blueprint.
This extension overwrites CSS classes to change the colors of the panel theme and introduces developers to panel customization.

**[Dashboard Overlay](https://github.com/teamblueprint/templates/tree/main/2/contents)**\

Uses the dashboard wrapper to place a fixed positioned iFrame over the panel contents.
